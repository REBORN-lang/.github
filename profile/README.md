# The REBORN Programming Language
**Reborn** (_stylized in all caps_) is a general-purpose, statically typed, low-level programming language. \
The **REBORN-lang** organization is actively working on making **REBORN** the best successor to [**C**](https://www.c-language.org/) thanks to low-level \
memory control and modernized straightforward syntax that is both useful for experienced developers and easy for beginners.

---

# Clarifications
* This organization, and its members are the only entities able to modify the **REBORN Standard** (_**RS** for short_) \
  This said, any developer will be able to propose changes to the **Standard** once our website is finished.
* [**C/REBORN**](github.com/reborn-lang/creborn) is currently the **only** official implementation of the **REBORN** programming language.
