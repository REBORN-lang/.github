# The REBORN Programming Language
**Reborn** (_stylized in all caps_) is a general-purpose, statically typed, _medium_-level programming language. \
The **REBORN-lang** organization is actively working on making **REBORN** the best successor to [**C**](https://www.c-language.org/) thanks to low-level \
memory control and modernized straightforward syntax that is both useful for experienced developers and easy for beginners.
